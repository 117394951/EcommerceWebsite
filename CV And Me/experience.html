         <h3>August 2017-Present</h3>
         <br/>
         <p>Currently, I worked in Tequila Jack's Mexican Restaraunt and Bar. I am a part time Waitress and Bar Staff there. I am also tried as a Barista here, making all types of coffees.</p>
         <br/>
         
         <h3>March 2016-April 2017</h3>
         <br/>
         <p>For 15 months, I worked part-time with Kirby’s Korner Bar & Restaurant, Ballinhassig, Co. Cork, a large and busy restaurant as a Waitress and Bar staff. 	I waited tables taking food and drink orders, serving same to customers, promoting various dishes and clearing and resetting tables promptly for the next customers due in.	I occasionally served drinks behind the Bar. 
        	In each role I took payment from customers and worked the cash register.</p>
         <br/>
         
         <h3>March 2015</h3>
         <br/>
         <p>As part of the Transition Year programme, I completed the two week Work Experience Module in Bull and Fiddle Fitness, Ballyphehane Community Centre and Dennehy’s Health and Fitness Gym, Douglas Village Shopping Centre.	While working in each gym I shadowed Personal Training sessions and various Fitness Classes (Spinning, HIIT etc.).	I dealt with customers by answering their questions and promoting the gym.	I made sure the gym was always clean and equipment readily available to use.

Working in both of these gyms really gave me an insight to a working environment. I was able to build on my Teamwork skills by taking instruction from Management and Personal Trainers on tasks to be completed. I also developed valuable communication skills by observing how staff dealt with customers and improved my own interaction with customers by attending Fitness Classes and Personal Training sessions. I feel I gained maturity from this experience.

<h3>November 2014</h3>
<br/>
<p>I completed one week of Community Work in Gorta Charity Shop, North Main St, Cork which was another Transition Year Module. 	During my time in Gorta I worked behind the counter serving customers and operating the cash register. I organised, priced and displayed stock to maximise sales and I also checked the stock for any outdated garments. I dealt with questions from customers and learned how to handle a variety of queries that arose</p>
