        <h2>More about me</h2><br/>
        <p>I am a free lance makeup artist. I have a great interest in makeup and have a successful instagram blog called rcoleman_mu with tips and pictures of makeup looks.
        I am frequently requested to complete makeovers for various events for my clients.
        I enjoy practicing with various colours and styles on myself. Getting redy is my favourite part of the day.</p><br/>
        <p>I very much enjoy physical sports such as Camogie. I played Camogie with Ballinhassig Camogie Club for seven years.
       One of my greatest achievements playing Camogie was winning a County Medal in 2010. 
       I co-operated well with my team mates and on many occasions took on the role as Captain, I always ensured that I motivated and encouraged my team all the time.
       I was a very dedicated player attending all training sessions and matches.</p><br/>
        <p>I was involved with a programme called YSI (Young Social Innovators) through the Transition Year programme. 
        My team and I aimed to make a difference with the effect of video games on children. 
        We extensively researched this topic and are currently trying to enforce a legislation whereby the appropriate age category is placed on all games.</p>
