	        <div class="section" id="section1">I very much enjoy physical sports such as Camogie. I played Camogie with Ballinhassig Camogie Club for seven years. One of my greatest achievements playing Camogie was winning a County Medal in 2010. I co-operated well with my team mates and on many occasions took on the role as Captain, I always ensured that I motivated and encouraged my team all the time. I was a very dedicated player attending all training sessions and matches.</div>
	        <div class="section" id="section2">I am a free lance makeup artist. I have a great interest in makeup and have a successful instagram blog called rcoleman_mu with tips and pictures of makeup looks. I am frequently requested to complete makeovers for various events.</div>
	        <div class="section" id="section3">I was involved with a programme called YSI (Young Social Innovators) through the Transition Year programme. My team and I aimed to make a difference with the effect of video games on children. We extensively researched this topic and are currently trying to enforce a legislation whereby the appropriate age category is placed on all games.
